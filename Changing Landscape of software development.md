## Changing Landscape of software development (a QA perspective)

**Background**: I was working as QA for the last couple of years. I am trying to leave the profession in favor of other sections. Below is the thought process behind my decision.

QA's are typically involved in the last step of software development. Expectations are from a good understanding of the problem statements, and a tight schedule. The task comes with more repetition and varied levels of problem-solving. A typical QA task can be divided into automation and manual. Let us discuss each for a bit:

Automation- 
-  helps to run repetitive tasks
-  It can be generated from the code base itself. An LLM( large language model) can be used to run inferences 
Manual-
- the tasks which required human intervention(filling captcha)

Both tasks can be performed by the developer. As they have more exposure to the logic. But this method may lead to weak coverage due to inherent bias. Pair programming can resolve these issues.


There are other types of testing are performance testing and penetration testing require experts from many units.

Conclusion: By transfer responsibility for testing to a developer will be an effective solution. And being a professional tester may need to learn different skills to keep oneself relevant.
